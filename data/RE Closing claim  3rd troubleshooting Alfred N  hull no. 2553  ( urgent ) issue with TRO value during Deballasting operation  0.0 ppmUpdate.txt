Dear Joy, 

Good Day, 

Please note that Vessel has received spares. 

Defective Solenoid valve and Pressure regulator has been replaced with spares.CLX-2 unit seems to 
be working fine and sample can be clearly drawn into the Cuvette for analysis,which was missing 
earlier and was our initial problem. 

So the above problem seems to be sorted,so will close this email trail. 

Please note that Vessel  faced another issue with regards to CLX-1 during last de-ballasting 
operations,will share details in fresh e-mail. 


Thanks for the help.

Dear Joy, 

Good Day, 


RBM and Ref. telecon,Vessel requires only  two small spare parts which need to replaced: 

1.	Solenoid valve(Sample  intake) 
2.	Water pressure Regulator 

Please advise if only these items can be supplied separately rather than supplying the complete unit 
as it is very expensive. Vessel does not require complete intake assembly.

Dear Shashank, 
 

Good day. 
 

Regarding the CLX and XGT TRO discrepency, vessel is requipped with mA type of equipment and it's natually 
happened of small discrepency. Therefore, kindly understand on this type. 
 

Herewith attached "SE Opinion" on this more in details 
 

Regarding the regualtor and intake sol valve, we'd like to confirm the maker firstly. Please check if it's installed with 
same equipment as per below photo.

Deballasting operation 0.0 ppm/Update 
 

Dear Joy, 
 
 

Good Day, 
RBM,Apologies for delayed reply as Vessel was trading in Europe with frequent port calls. 
Please note that Vessel has been able to troubleshoot the problem. There was no issue with the ppm 
indication on HMI Panel. The only problem which Vessel has been able to identify is with intake 
solenoid valve of CLX-2 unit and water pressure regulator. As per your suggestion after replacing 
optical assembly,intake solenoid valve followed by complete chassis(PCB Assembly)) it was 
determined that intake solenoid valve and water pressure regulator for CLX-2 was found not 
operating, leading to improper measurement of concentration. 
 
 

As per your previous message since TSU is equipped with dry contact type of model,HMI shows the 
low TRO reading among the No.1 & N.2 CLX during deballasting operation.Since the intake solenoid 
and water pressure regulator  of CLX-2 was faulty it always showed 0 ppm as it never drew any 
sample . CLX-1 did show reading however it was always showing on higher side hence never picked 
by the HMI,which went un-noticed by the previous ship staff.That is why HMI panel always showed 0 
ppm,as it was taking value from CLX-2 unit rather than CLX-1 
Going further there is minor difference between value(0.02 ppm) shown on CLX-1 and XGT 
Panel,means if CLX-1 is showing 0.05 than 0.03 will be displayed on XGT Panel and HMI Panel,kindly 
advise if anything can be done about it. CLX-2 ppm values are consistent and same every where.The 
condition remained same after interchanging PCBs(chassis). 
 
 

 
 

Please go through the attachment for better understanding. 
 
 

Below are the answers for the queries(some old answers are also included) 
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
RBM,Please note Vessel comments against queries raised: 
 
 

1. Your vessel's TSU is equipped with dry contach type of model. HMI will be instructed the low TRO 
reading among the No.1 & N.2 CLX during deballasting operation. 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Noted 
2. According to your feedback, we assume that No.2 CLX TRO value indicated on the HIM. 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Yes 
3. [Request] Request you to check the bypass brown tubing inside the No.1 CLX,  if it's stuck. 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Tubing was found clear 
4. We assume that No.2 CLX may have some problem among the CLX optic assy, chassis or intake 
assy because it's no sound during TRO sensing stage. 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Noted 
5.[Request]  To confirm the defect, please carry out swap test the parts between No.1 CLX and No.2 
CLX one by one as per below. 
    -  Swap the optic assy firstly. ( No.1 CLX optic assy <-> No.2 CLX optic assy) 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Swap test carried out,optic assembly found working satisfactory,please refer 
attachment.Please note that both the optic assembly Ex-rated,were changed with TSU CLX-2,one at a 
time.Both were found to give correct readings suggesting perfect conditions of optic assembly.Rather 
than   interchanging with each other they were assembled in Ballasting Unit CLX-2,to determine 
performance. 
 -  After swapping the optic assy, if the problem still persist then also swap the intake assy. ( No.1 
CLX  intake assy <-> No.2 CLX  intake assy) 
 -  Check the operation status, if it's still not working, please swap the chassis as well. ( No.1 
CLX  chassis assy <-> No.2 CLX chassis assy) 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Problem identified with Intake solenoid and water pressure regulator of CLX-2 
 
 

Vessel is running BWTS  system under observation,any problem if noticed will be reported without 
delay.

4. We assume that No.2 CLX may have some problem among the CLX optic assy, chassis or intake 
assy because it's no sound during TRO sensing stage. 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Noted 
5.[Request]  To confirm the defect, please carry out swap test the parts between No.1 CLX and No.2 
CLX one by one as per below. 
    -  Swap the optic assy firstly. ( No.1 CLX optic assy <-> No.2 CLX optic assy) 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Swap test carried out,optic assembly found working satisfactory,please refer 
attachment.Please note that both the optic assembly Ex-rated,were changed with TSU CLX-2,one at a 
time.Both were found to give correct readings suggesting perfect conditions of optic assembly.Rather 
than   interchanging with each other they were assembled in Ballasting Unit CLX-2,to determine 
performance. 
 
 

    -  After swapping the optic assy, if the problem still persist then also swap the intake assy. ( No.1 
CLX  intake assy <-> No.2 CLX  intake assy) 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Reverting shortly with results 
 
 

    -  Check the operation status, if it's still not working, please swap the chassis as well. ( No.1 
CLX  chassis assy <-> No.2 CLX chassis assy) 
VESSEL COMMENTS: Reverting shortly with results 
 
 

Reverting shortly with other Results after carrying out tests as recommended

Dear Ms. Joy, 
Good Day, 
 
 

Vessel is on the way to US where USCG is scheduled. 
At Present , system is working fine with one CLX so we don’t want to take chance by swapping this with no. 2 
CLX. 
Once vessel complete USCG and out of US , we will ask vessel to carry out below checks and swapping and 
then update you for further advise 
 
 

Thanks and Regards

Good day. 
 
 

We thank you for your message below. 
 
 

Here is the 1st troubleshooting for the TRO issue. Please see below instructions and follow the steps 
accordingly, revert with inspection comments in details. 
 
 

1. Your vessel's TSU is equipped with dry contach type of model. HMI will be instructed the low TRO 
reading among the No.1 & N.2 CLX during deballasting operation. 
 
 

2. According to your feedback, we assume that No.2 CLX TRO value indicated on the HIM. 
 
 

3. [Request] Request you to check the bypass brown tubing inside the No.1 CLX,  if it's stuck. 
 
 

4. We assume that No.2 CLX may have some problem among the CLX optic assy, chassis or intake 
assy because it's no sound during TRO sensing stage. 
 
 

5.[Request]  To confirm the defect, please carry out swap test the parts between No.1 CLX and No.2 
CLX one by one as per below. 
    -  Swap the optic assy firstly. ( No.1 CLX optic assy <-> No.2 CLX optic assy) 
    -  After swapping the optic assy, if the problem still persist then also swap the intake assy. ( No.1 
CLX  intake assy <-> No.2 CLX  intake assy) 
    -  Check the operation status, if it's still not working, please swap the chassis as well. ( No.1 
CLX  chassis assy <-> No.2 CLX chassis assy) 
 
 

We are looking forward to hearing your feedback. 
 
 

Thank you & best regards,

Dear Joy , 
 
 
 
 

Good Day 
 
 
 
 

Trust you are doing well. 
 
 
 
 

Please note previous Chief Engineer has signed off,hence from now onwards I will be communicating with 
you. 
 
 
 
 

RBM,Kindly go through the Photos which I have compiled in an excel sheet. 
 
 
 
 

Going further I carried out few tests to determine cause of the problem which has been there for quite some 
time.During performance testing few problems were observed which are as follows: 
 
 
 
 

1)     TRO value during De-ballasting is not reflecting on the HMI Monitor in the CCR.I tried selecting CLX 
1 & CLX 2,however I could never see value going beyond 0.01 on the HMI monitor during De-
ballasting,during that time the Values on CLX 1 and XGT panel were matching,however on the 
monitor it was different around 0.0/0.01 with CLX 1 selected on the Monitor.During this time value 
on CLX Unit 1 was 0.62/0.63.In CLX -1 the sample is being drawn and analysed perfectly  unlike CLX-
2. 
2)     CLX 2,there has been an issue with sample intake in Cuvette.Though priming of the CLX-2 unit can 
be carried out normally,however the clicking sound while drawing sample in CLX-2 is missing which 
can be heard for CLX-1.There is no clicking sound to draw sample however sample “LED “ can be 
seen flickering on the CLX -2 PCB,suspect problem with intake solenoid/PCB/signal.Just to elaborate 
further water callibration is not happening after priming is completed. 
3)     To start with please provide guidance to troubleshoot above problems.If the values on XGT Panel 
and CLX units are matching,suspect  communication issues with HMI. 
 
 
 
 

Going further please also provide your whatsapp number so that I can send you short videos for 
troubleshooting. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Please feel free to ask for further data.I will carry out further tests once Weather improves.Vessel has been 
experiencing heavy weather for last couple of days.

Good day! 
 
 
 
 

We duly received your message regarding TRO Low issue.  
 
 
 
 

Please keep all in CC in this loop for further smooth communication. 
 
 
 
 

Please see below requirement and revert with feedback accordingly. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

1) Overhaul APU operation  
-  Refer to attached "APU overhaul guildance" ( 2 attachment), and check pressure bar setting to 
2.5~3.5 bar. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

2) Refer to attached "check point in CLX" and clean the line which is connected to backside of optic 
assy. 
 
 
 
 

3) Make sure to clean all check valve / solenoid valve / Y-strainer as per attahced "TRO Low alarm 
sampling " guildance. 
 
 
 
 

4) Check sampling water is properly flowed into the cuvette. ( If it's working in normal, you will 
observe it turns to PINK/RED colour as per photo below.  
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

5) Carry out priming test at least 4~5 times in a row and try to run the system to check further TRO 
PPM. 
 
 
 
 

6) If it's still showing "0.00" PPM, please refer to attached item 1)~6) and revert with same page of 
HMI photos and log data for our reference.

Good day Sir, 
 
 
 
 
 

Dear joy 
 
 
 
 
 

 Thank you  for your valuable inputs to resolve our de-ballasting issue . 
 Please note that as per your advise TRO setting on the tank we changed from 0 to 2  and internal 
setting on the pop- screen less than 22 days for tank TRO setting and de- ballasting operation . 
After making changes we tried out the de- ballasting operation for port / stbd side we found ANU 
dosing as per set value start from 800 ml/m to as per the CLX TRO values automatically .   
At present we tried out the system for remote HMI from CCR , CCR HMI panel showing TRO 
value  and dosing rate for the port and stbd operation . 
STBD operation : TRO value=   2.19    ppm ,  ANU dosing Rate =   44        ml/m 
PORT side operation : TRO value=    0.61   ppm ,  ANU dosing Rate =  17         ml/m 
 Vessel did not use the attached setup file as mentioned in request 2.  Kindly advise if attached setup 
file need to update the system ? 
ANU metering pump EXT mode setting checked system working satisfactory 
 Please find attached photos for your reference , vessel will send  videos for the both side port / stbd 
de- ballasting operation  on your whatsapp. 
   
Kindly note that vessel will  plan to perform de- ballasting operation from local station , tomorrow 
will revert with the operation out comes . 
  
 Thank you once again to you and  your team

spm  stroke , in oder to check setting status of the metering pump when we press EXT 
and UP key simultanously ,the display of the pump not showing DIG and set lights 
according to the instruction manual , and hence we are not able to check setting . 
Please note that we observed the flow rate looks same as per the setting in both the 
pumps . as you can observe in attached videos .

metering pump operation status about 1 mins and revert to us.  
 
 
 
 
 

Third, After completion of all above test, please revert with the latest log file for our reference.  
 
 
 
 
 

 * During the initial stage of deballast operation start, the neutralizer will be discharged at max 
(800ml/min) and discharge amount will be reduced based on the TRO value. The STBD side will be 
discharged by right side of the ANU metering pump, PORT will be discharged by the lest side of the 
ANU metering pump. 
 
 
 
 
 

Forth, Please tap HMI ADMIN -> Passworkd : 3500 -> take clear photo of the HMI setting page.

Please note that vessel has replaced A/O module with new supplied one as suggested by TECHROSS 
Technical department. But during last de-ballasting operation through bwts system ANU is still non-
operational. Ex CLX unit showing 1.2 ppm which is reflected in XGT panel of TSU unit situated at near 
ANU unit showing same 
 Kindly advise irrespective of 1.2 ppm value the ANU is not operational and that value is not showing 
in our Control pc  and dosing of neutralizing agent through metering pump of ANU is 0 mg/ltr  and 
metering pump is also showing 0 PPM on its display. The problem is still same. Pls advise further.

Dear  Lakhan, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Good day. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In the reveiwing of vessel feedback report by out tech team, the root caused of this problem would 
be due to the metering pump which is not cotrolled. The power is applied to the metering pump, 
however it seems not being controlled properly. 
According to the report, we check the neutralizer is not been discharged after deballasting 
operation,  even in the condition of the left side of the metering pump ( A1, PORT) is OFF and right 
side (A2, STBD) is ON. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

In addition, based on the latest S/E attendance report of your good vessel on 2021.07.09~11, we 
check the AO module error lamp of ANU PLC was turned ON.  
 
In this regard, we advise you to replace a new AO561 module firstly then carry out operation test for 
further inspection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

<Necessary spare> 
1) PLC (TC000831) / 1EA - USD 480 + Actual cost ( Packing & Delivery) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Please let us know the PO number for the spare and consignee details. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Thank you.
