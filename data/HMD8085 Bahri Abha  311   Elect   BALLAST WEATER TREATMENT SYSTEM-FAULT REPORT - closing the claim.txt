SYSTEM-FAULT REPORT - draft invoice  
Importance: High 
  
Dear Ms. Uri Ko, 
  
You attached draft is mathematically correct, subject to the actual hours from the time 
sheets. 
  
Whereas, please kindly check whether you can have reduced daily rates where the total 
hours are exceeding certain allocated daily working hours. 
  
For e.g., line no. 6, Travel & Waiting 2 Man 34 Hours each seen as very expensive. 
Therefore, can you please apply some kind of reduced daily rate concept to have reasonable 
total? 
  
Additionally, we would obviously look for some special discount for our company when 
considering our long standing business dealings. 
  
Our estimated costing was around USD 8K for this job but it gone too high than our 
expectations. 
Therefore, please help us with the reduced total amount as much as you can.

Dear Mr. Iatusliak, 
  
Good day. 
  
Techcross engineers visited BAHRI ABHA on 31st Mar and did following works for BWMS. 
  
<Completed work> 
1. No.2 RCM shows no voltage, current on it, CAN Fail alarm 
  1) Cable condition check : No problem 
  2 Swap test with No.1 RMC : both RCM have can fail ? It means that each RCM has no 
problem 
  3) No.2 PRE CAN address change : No.2 RCM started to work normally during the ballasting 
operation 
  4) Please be kindly noted that No.2 RCM shows “CAN Fail” alarm when it is stand-by or stop 
condition. Only during ballasting operation, it won’t be appeared on the RCM display. 
  
2. Difference between ballasted water volume and flowrate on FMU 
  1) Engineers confirmed the normal condition of FMU. 
  2) Engineers ballasted flowrate as 400m3/h(=local FMU display) and it was recorded on the 
log as 400 after ballasting operation. Ship’s crews did a double check with our engineers. 
  
3. Health check on ECS  
1) ballasting operation : Good (TRO 5.54ppm) 
  2) de-ballasting operation : Good (TRO 0.00ppm) 
  
<Remained work> 
N/A 
  
<Used spare> 
N/A 
  
<Engineers recommendation, comments or request> 
N/A 
  
For now, ECS is ready for operation in good condition and there is no remained work or 
malfunction. 
  
Hope we could get PO No. to issue a service invoice in 1~1.5 month. 
  
Thank you.

Dear Mr. Iatsuliak, 
  
Good day. 
  
Having internal discussion, we changed our service plan. 
Because we do need 2 service engineers for this work, we gave up to arrange service engineers 
from Korea. Instead of dispatching engineers from Korea, we will call engineer from Rumania. 
If so, you may highly save flight ticket. Roughly, it will cost EUR 770 per person for round trip 
Rumania~Istanbul(tranfer)~Bahrain. 
  
Do you mind if we dispatch 2 service engineers? For better service and satisfied service result, 
we hope we can dispatch 2 engineers from Rumania. 
  
Thank you. 
  
Best regards,

Dear Mr. Latsuliak, 
  
Good day. 
  
I need your urgent confirmation. 
According to the ticket agency, it costs abt. USD 3,900 per 1 engineer for round trip between 
Bahrain and South Korea. We need to dispatch 2 engineers for ECS check in consideration of 
the vessel type. In this regard, I need your advanced confirmation on the flight ticket cost. 
  
Shall we proceed service in Bahrain continuously? 
  
Hope I can hear your soon. 
  
Thank you.

Dear Mr. Franulovic,  
   
Good day.  
   
As I said, it was very rough plan and quotation.   
I assumed that we may work as followings.  
DAY 1 ? Power Rectifier check and repar  
DAY 2 ? Maintenance, operation test, crew training  
   
However all our service is limited to port stay schedule. If the vessel will stay in port only for 1 
day, we will try to shorten the working hours. Engineers will clear priority works and they may 
remain minor issue when they have not enough time.  
   
Thank you.

Dear Mr. Franulovic,  
   
Good day.  
Just for your financial purpose, I send followings.  
(Very rough quotation)  
   
1. Working tariff   
We expect 2 men x 8 hrs x 2 days work.   
Since we have no expectation of berthing schedule, we estimate just refer to the attached tariff 
table.   
    
2. Traveling & waiting   
For engineers traveling & waiting, we charge USD 70/hour/man.   
Traveling origin is not fixed yet however most probably it would be from Rotterdam or Korea.   
    
3. Accommodation   
In case of Middle East area, USD 150/day/man.   
    
4. Meal   
USD 15/meal/man   
    
5. Administration   
We charge 10% of total tariff(working + traveling + waiting).   
    
6. etc.   
In case that other cost occurs like local transport, agency sundries, car rental, fuel, spare 
material, toll fee or launch, we add the cost on the final invoice.   
    
* Summary   
As a minimum, we estimate working + traveling tariff as USD 3,500. Every actual cost is not 
included.   
    
However it is up to the actual working time and condition. The final cost would be higher or 
lower than our estimation.   
  
Please keep me updated on the followings.   
-Rough schedule   
- The full-style of local agency in Jebel Ali   
    
Thank you.

Good day Ms. Ko, 
  
You are aware that we have replaced one rectifier unit on Bahri Abha with new type? 
I don’t think that parts are interactable. 
As this issue is going back and forward for quite some time, we are of opinion that service engineer 
attendance will be a good option. 
The vessel is expected in port of Jebel Ali  on / around  1st of March. 
Can you please send us your best quotation for attendance. 
Thank you in advance.

PTB-TB No.14, 15, 16 ~ DSP CAN-TB inside PDE. If there is any loosen or cut cable, let us 
know via photo.    
　2) Swap No.1 & 2 RCM and run ECS. Then check the voltage and current value.    
     
Thank you.

Dear Mr. Franulovic,    
     
Good day.    
     
It seems that No.2 A-PRE lower PRU is not working properly.    
  1) Please run ECS in ballasting mode and then take a photo on LED lamps on the PRU.    
  2) If upper PRU works but lower PRU doesn’t work proper, please refer to the attached photo 
and swap 3 kinds of inner boards one by one.   
  3) When you swap control board, IDU board, DC-DC converter one by one, please test ECS in 
ballasting mode for each swapping.    
  4) Finally, please swap 3 boards all together and let us know the working condition of PRU.    
     
Thank you.    
  
Best regards,

Good day Gents, 
  
Please note that two PRE units onboard are not of the same type, therefore parts are not 
interchangeable. 
Aft one, the green one, has been replaced back in 2019. 
Furthermore, remove protection from cable connection to ECU, 
and inspect condition of the electrode unit connectors for any leaks. 
When using the BWTS with one rectifying unit, make sure not to exceed half of the system capacity. 
Please send us some more photos of failed unit, ECU cable connectors,  include clear photo of the 
nameplate. 
Thank you in advance. 
  
Best regards,
