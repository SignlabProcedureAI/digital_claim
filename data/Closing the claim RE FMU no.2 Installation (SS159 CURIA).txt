  1) Refer to the attached guide, turn off the “simulation mode”. 
    # Guidance : WaterMaster Turning Simulation Mode On Off.mp4.mp4 
  2) Refer to 3 setting guidance, check every setting and status of flowrate fluctuating. 
    # Guidance : LTS_FMU_CUT OFF.mp4 / LTS_FMU_Damping_setting.mp4 / 
LTS_FMU_EMPTY PIPE.mp4 
  
We shall be waiting for your next feedback.

Dear Sergey, 
  
Good day. 
  
1. First, please confirm if HMI shows flowrate of No.2 FMU on its display while ballast pump is 
running. 
2. If HMI cannot show the flowrate, please refer to the attached video guidance and set the 
direction of flow of sensor. 
3. Also, during above trial, please take a photo showing flowrate display on HMI. 
  
Thank you.
