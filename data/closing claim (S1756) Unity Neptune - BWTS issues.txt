Good day dear Joy Cho, 
Pls. note that our good vessel Unity Neptune experience some problems with the BWTS. Seems to 
me both are software issues. 
 
 
 
 

Quote: 
1.	We have to download the program several times due to failures during downloading. 
2.	It is not possible to use Plant No.2 alone during ballasting. Ballasting is possible by Plant No.1 
& Plant No.2 simultaneously or by Plant No.1 only. 
Unquote. 
 
 
 
 

The issue appears since last software update during DD 2022. Actually, the vessel has to use both 
pumps during discharging and recently happened that one pump required to be use, and they find 
out the problem. 
 Please find attached defect report and separate report with photos.
