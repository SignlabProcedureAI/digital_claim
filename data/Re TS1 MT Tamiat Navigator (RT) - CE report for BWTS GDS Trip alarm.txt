Dear Mr. Kim 
Good day 
  
We appreciate your patience for our reply. 
  
The GDS detected H2 gas alarm is due to “HC GAS DETECTION” not related to the GDS itself. 
Please inspect the system according to the following guide. 
  
1. Please remove the cable 13&14 on DI-TB. 
2. Push the “reset” on HMI and check whether the alarm disappears. 
3. If the alarm disappears, please inspect HC GAS DETECTIPN signal (this is within the owner’s scope) 
  
For your information, we send the connection diagram as an attachment. 
Please provide the feedback after this inspection and feel free to contact us if you face any difficulties 
during this inspection. 
  
We look forward your feedback. 
Best regards,
